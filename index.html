            Static code warning tools often generate warnings that programmers ignore. Such tools can be made more useful via data mining algorithms that select the actionable warnings; i.e. the warnings that are usually not ignored. In this paper, we look for actionable warnings within a sample of 5,675 actionable warnings seen in 31,058 static code warnings from FindBugs. We find that data mining algorithms can find actionable warnings with remarkable ease. We implement deep neural networks in Keras and PyTorch with static defect artifacts to predict real defects to act on. Utilize regularisers to avoid DNN models from overfitting and lower the runnning overhead. Use Box-counting methods to explore the intrinsic dimension of SE data and match the complexity of machine learning algorithms with the datasets it handles.

            Static code analysis is a widely-used method for detecting bugs and security vulnerabilities in software systems. As software becomes more complex, analysis tools also report lists of increasingly complex warnings that developers need to address on a daily basis. Such static code analysis tools are usually over-cautious; i.e. they often offer many warnings about spurious issues. In this paper, we identify actionable static warnings of nine Java projects generated by FindBugs with incrementally active learning and machine learning algorithms to achieve higher recall with lower cost by reducing false alarm. And utilize different sampling approaches (random sampling, uncertainty sampling and certainty sampling) to query warnings suggested by active learning algorithm. Interact the system with human oracle to update the system.

            <p>
            How can we make software analytics simpler and faster One method is to match the complexity of analysis to the intrinsic complexity of the data being explored. For example, hyperparameter optimizers find the control settings for data miners that improve the predictions generated via software analytics. Sometimes, very fast hyperparameter optimization can be achieved by <b>DODGE-ing</b>; i.e. simply steering way from settings that lead to similar conclusions. But when is it wise to use that simple approach and when must we use more complex (and much slower) optimizers To answer this, we applied hyperparameter optimization to 120 SE data sets that explored bad smell detection, predicting Github issue close time, bug report analysis, defect prediction, and dozens of other non-SE problems. We find that the simple DODGE works best for data sets with low <b>intrinsic dimensionality</b> (around 3) and very poorly for higher-dimensional data (around 8). Nearly all the SE data seen here was intrinsically low-dimensional, indicating that DODGE is applicable for many SE analytics tasks.

            Is deep learning over-hyped? Where are the case studies that compare state-of-the-art deep learners with simpler options? In response to this gap in the literature, this paper offers one case study on using deep learning to predict issue close time in Bugzilla. We report here that a SIMPLE extension to a decades-old feedforward neural network works better than the more recent, and more elaborate, <b>long-short term memory</b> deep learning (which are currently popular in the SE literature). SIMPLE is a combination of a fast feedforward network and a hyper-parameter optimizer. SIMPLE runs in 3 seconds while the newer algorithms take 6 hours to terminate. Since it runs so fast, it is more amenable to being tuned by our optimizer. This paper reports results seen after running SIMPLE on issue close time data from 45,364 issues raised in Chromium, Eclipse, and Firefox projects from January 2010 to March 2016.

            Nowadays, the effective credit scoring becomes a very crucial factor for gaining competitive advantages in credit market for both customers and corporations. In this paper, we propose a credit scoring method which combines the non-kernel fuzzy 2-norm quadratic surface SVM model, T-test feature weighting strategy and fuzzy within-class scatter together. It is worth pointing out that this new method not only saves computational time by avoiding choosing a kernel and corresponding parameters in the classical SVM models, but also addresses the <b>curse of dimensionality</b> issue and improves the robustness. Besides, we develop an efficient way to calculate the fuzzy membership of each training point by solving a linear programming problem. Finally, we conduct several numerical tests on two benchmark data sets of personal credit and one real-world data set of corporation credit. The numerical results strongly demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms eight state-of-the-art and commonly-used credit scoring methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
